39398866,Characterization of arteriosclerosis based on computer-aided measurements of intra-arterial thickness,"PURPOSE: Our purpose is to develop a computer vision approach to quantify intra-arterial thickness on digital pathology images of kidney biopsies as a computational biomarker of arteriosclerosis.
APPROACH: The severity of the arteriosclerosis was scored (0 to 3) in 753 arteries from 33 trichrome-stained whole slide images (WSIs) of kidney biopsies, and the outer contours of the media, intima, and lumen were manually delineated by a renal pathologist. We then developed a multi-class deep learning (DL) framework for segmenting the different intra-arterial compartments (training dataset: 648 arteries from 24 WSIs; testing dataset: 105 arteries from 9 WSIs). Subsequently, we employed radial sampling and made measurements of media and intima thickness as a function of spatially encoded polar coordinates throughout the artery. Pathomic features were extracted from the measurements to collectively describe the arterial wall characteristics. The technique was first validated through numerical analysis of simulated arteries, with systematic deformations applied to study their effect on arterial thickness measurements. We then compared these computationally derived measurements with the pathologists' grading of arteriosclerosis.
RESULTS: Numerical validation shows that our measurement technique adeptly captured the decreasing smoothness in the intima and media thickness as the deformation increases in the simulated arteries. Intra-arterial DL segmentations of media, intima, and lumen achieved Dice scores of 0.84, 0.78, and 0.86, respectively. Several significant associations were identified between arteriosclerosis grade and pathomic features using our technique (e.g., intima-media ratio average [ τ = 0.52  , p &lt; 0.0001  ]) through Kendall's tau analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a computer vision approach to computationally characterize intra-arterial morphology on digital pathology images and demonstrate its feasibility as a potential computational biomarker of arteriosclerosis.",computer_vision,deep learning
39390053,Multi-scale input layers and dense decoder aggregation network for COVID-19 lesion segmentation from CT scans,"Accurate segmentation of COVID-19 lesions from medical images is essential for achieving precise diagnosis and developing effective treatment strategies. Unfortunately, this task presents significant challenges, owing to the complex and diverse characteristics of opaque areas, subtle differences between infected and healthy tissue, and the presence of noise in CT images. To address these difficulties, this paper designs a new deep-learning architecture (named MD-Net) based on multi-scale input layers and dense decoder aggregation network for COVID-19 lesion segmentation. In our framework, the U-shaped structure serves as the cornerstone to facilitate complex hierarchical representations essential for accurate segmentation. Then, by introducing the multi-scale input layers (MIL), the network can effectively analyze both fine-grained details and contextual information in the original image. Furthermore, we introduce an SE-Conv module in the encoder network, which can enhance the ability to identify relevant information while simultaneously suppressing the transmission of extraneous or non-lesion information. Additionally, we design a dense decoder aggregation (DDA) module to integrate feature distributions and important COVID-19 lesion information from adjacent encoder layers. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative analysis and comparison between two publicly available datasets, namely Vid-QU-EX and QaTa-COV19-v2, to assess the robustness and versatility of MD-Net in segmenting COVID-19 lesions. The experimental results show that the proposed MD-Net has superior performance compared to its competitors, and it exhibits higher scores on the Dice value, Matthews correlation coefficient (Mcc), and Jaccard index. In addition, we also conducted ablation studies on the Vid-QU-EX dataset to evaluate the contributions of each key component within the proposed architecture.",computer_vision,"deep-learning, decoder, encoder"
39367648,An initial game-theoretic assessment of enhanced tissue preparation and imaging protocols for improved deep learning inference of spatial transcriptomics from tissue morphology,"The application of deep learning to spatial transcriptomics (ST) can reveal relationships between gene expression and tissue architecture. Prior work has demonstrated that inferring gene expression from tissue histomorphology can discern these spatial molecular markers to enable population scale studies, reducing the fiscal barriers associated with large-scale spatial profiling. However, while most improvements in algorithmic performance have focused on improving model architectures, little is known about how the quality of tissue preparation and imaging can affect deep learning model training for spatial inference from morphology and its potential for widespread clinical adoption. Prior studies for ST inference from histology typically utilize manually stained frozen sections with imaging on non-clinical grade scanners. Training such models on ST cohorts is also costly. We hypothesize that adopting tissue processing and imaging practices that mirror standards for clinical implementation (permanent sections, automated tissue staining, and clinical grade scanning) can significantly improve model performance. An enhanced specimen processing and imaging protocol was developed for deep learning-based ST inference from morphology. This protocol featured the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated hematoxylin and eosin staining (e.g. Leica Bond), 40×-resolution imaging, and joining of multiple patients' tissue sections per capture area prior to ST profiling. Using a cohort of 13 pathologic T Stage-III stage colorectal cancer patients, we compared the performance of models trained on slide prepared using enhanced versus traditional (i.e. manual staining and low-resolution imaging) protocols. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we predicted gene expression across serial, histologically-matched tissue sections using whole slide images (WSI) from both protocols. The data Shapley was used to quantify and compare marginal performance gains on a patient-by-patient basis attributed to using the enhanced protocol versus the actual costs of spatial profiling. Findings indicate that training and validating on WSI acquired through the enhanced protocol as opposed to the traditional method resulted in improved performance at lower fiscal cost. In the realm of ST, the enhancement of deep learning architectures frequently captures the spotlight; however, the significance of specimen processing and imaging is often understated. This research, informed through a game-theoretic lens, underscores the substantial impact that specimen preparation/imaging can have on spatial transcriptomic inference from morphology. It is essential to integrate such optimized processing protocols to facilitate the identification of prognostic markers at a larger scale.",both,"deep learning, neural network"
39363262,Truncated M13 phage for smart detection of E. coli under dark field,"BACKGROUND: The urgent need for affordable and rapid detection methodologies for foodborne pathogens, particularly Escherichia coli (E. coli), highlights the importance of developing efficient and widely accessible diagnostic systems. Dark field microscopy, although effective, requires specific isolation of the target bacteria which can be hindered by the high cost of producing specialized antibodies. Alternatively, M13 bacteriophage, which naturally targets E. coli, offers a cost-efficient option with well-established techniques for its display and modification. Nevertheless, its filamentous structure with a large length-diameter ratio contributes to nonspecific binding and low separation efficiency, posing significant challenges. Consequently, refining M13 phage methodologies and their integration with advanced microscopy techniques stands as a critical pathway to improve detection specificity and efficiency in food safety diagnostics.
METHODS: We employed a dual-plasmid strategy to generate a truncated M13 phage (tM13). This engineered tM13 incorporates two key genetic modifications: a partial mutation at the N-terminus of pIII and biotinylation at the hydrophobic end of pVIII. These alterations enable efficient attachment of tM13 to diverse E. coli strains, facilitating rapid magnetic separation. For detection, we additionally implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for precise identification and quantification of bacterial cells using dark field microscopy.
RESULTS: The results obtained from spike-in and clinical sample analyses demonstrated the accuracy, high sensitivity (with a detection limit of 10 CFU/μL), and time-saving nature (30 min) of our tM13-based immunomagnetic enrichment approach combined with AI-enabled analytics, thereby supporting its potential to facilitate the identification of diverse E. coli strains in complex samples.
CONCLUSION: The study established a rapid and accurate detection strategy for E. coli utilizing truncated M13 phages as capture probes, along with a dark field microscopy detection platform that integrates an image processing model and convolutional neural network.",computer_vision,"cnn, convolutional neural network, neural network"
39287522,AI for Multistructure Incidental Findings and Mortality Prediction at Chest CT in Lung Cancer Screening,"Background Incidental extrapulmonary findings are commonly detected on chest CT scans and can be clinically important. Purpose To integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation for multiple structures, coronary artery calcium (CAC), and epicardial adipose tissue with automated feature extraction methods and machine learning to detect extrapulmonary abnormalities and predict all-cause mortality (ACM) in a large multicenter cohort. Materials and Methods In this post hoc analysis, baseline chest CT scans in patients enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) from August 2002 to September 2007 were included from 33 participating sites. Per scan, 32 structures were segmented with a multistructure model. For each structure, 15 clinically interpretable radiomic features were quantified. Four general codes describing abnormalities reported by NLST radiologists were applied to identify extrapulmonary significant incidental findings on the CT scans. Death at 2-year and 10-year follow-up and the presence of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were predicted with ensemble AI models, and individualized structure risk scores were evaluated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the models for prediction of ACM and extrapulmonary significant incidental findings. The Pearson χ2 test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analyses. Results A total of 24 401 participants (median age, 61 years [IQR, 57-65 years]; 14 468 male) were included. In 3880 of 24 401 participants (16%), 4283 extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were reported. During the 10-year follow-up, 3389 of 24 401 participants (14%) died. CAC had the highest feature importance for predicting the three study end points. The 10-year ACM model demonstrated the best AUC performance (0.72; per-year mortality of 2.6% above and 0.8% below the risk threshold), followed by 2-year ACM (0.71; per-year mortality of 1.13% above and 0.3% below the risk threshold) and prediction of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings (0.70; probability of occurrence of 25.4% above and 9.6% below the threshold). Conclusion A fully automated AI model indicated extrapulmonary structures at risk on chest CT scans and predicted ACM with explanations.

39275979,Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: Perspectives from both facility staff and users,"Modern bioimaging core facilities at research institutions are essential for managing and maintaining high-end instruments, providing training and support for researchers in experimental design, image acquisition and data analysis. An important task for these facilities is the professional management of complex multidimensional bioimaging data, which are often produced in large quantity and very different file formats. This article details the process that led to successfully implementing the OME Remote Objects system (OMERO) for bioimage-specific research data management (RDM) at the Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI) at the Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden). Ensuring compliance with the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles, we outline here the challenges that we faced in adapting data handling and storage to a new RDM system. These challenges included the introduction of a standardised group-specific naming convention, metadata curation with tagging and Key-Value pairs, and integration of existing image processing workflows. By sharing our experiences, this article aims to provide insights and recommendations for both individual researchers and educational institutions intending to implement OMERO as a management system for bioimaging data. We showcase how tailored decisions and structured approaches lead to successful outcomes in RDM practices.",computer_vision,
39273393,Digital Whole Slide Image Analysis of Elevated Stromal Content and Extracellular Matrix Protein Expression Predicts Adverse Prognosis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. This study evaluates the prognostic value of stromal markers in TNBC, focusing on the tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) and overall stroma ratio (OSR) in whole slide images (WSI), as well as the expression of type-I collagen, type-III collagen, and fibrillin-1 on tissue microarrays (TMAs), using both visual assessment and digital image analysis (DIA). A total of 101 female TNBC patients, primarily treated with surgery between 2005 and 2016, were included. We found that high visual OSR correlates with worse overall survival (OS), advanced pN categories, lower stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte count (sTIL), lower mitotic index, and patient age (p &lt; 0.05). TSR showed significant connections to the pN category and mitotic index (p &lt; 0.01). High expression levels of type-I collagen (&gt;45%), type-III collagen (&gt;30%), and fibrillin-1 (&gt;20%) were linked to significantly worse OS (p = 0.004, p = 0.013, and p = 0.005, respectively) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.028, p = 0.025, and p = 0.002, respectively), validated at the mRNA level. Our results highlight the importance of stromal characteristics in promoting tumor progression and metastasis and that targeting extracellular matrix (ECM) components may offer novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, DIA can be more accurate and objective in evaluating TSR, OSR, and immunodetected stromal markers than traditional visual examination.",computer_vision,
39269702,Health Warnings on Instagram Advertisements for Synthetic Nicotine E-Cigarettes and Engagement,"IMPORTANCE: Synthetic nicotine is increasingly used in e-cigarette liquids along with flavors to appeal to youths. Regulatory loopholes have allowed tobacco manufacturers to use social media to target youths.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the extent to which synthetic nicotine e-cigarette brands have implemented US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) health warning requirements and to evaluate the association between health warnings and user engagement on Instagram.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, posts from 25 brands were analyzed across a 14-month period (August 2021 to October 2022). A content analysis was paired with Warning Label Multi-Layer Image Identification, a computer vision algorithm designed to detect the presence of health warnings and whether the detected health warning complied with FDA guidelines by (1) appearing on the upper portion of the advertisement and (2) occupying at least 20% of the advertisement's area. Data analysis was performed from March to June 2024.
EXPOSURE: Synthetic nicotine e-cigarette advertisement on Instagram.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome variables were user engagement (number of likes and comments). Negative binomial regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between the presence and characteristics of health warnings and user engagement.
RESULTS: Of a total of 2071 posts, only 263 (13%) complied with both FDA health warning requirements. Among 924 posts with health warnings, 732 (79%) displayed warnings in the upper image portion, and 270 (29%) had a warning covering at least 20% of the pixel area. Posts with warnings received fewer comments than posts without warnings (mean [SD], 1.8 [2.5] vs 5.4 [11.7] comments; adjusted incident rate ratio [aIRR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.86; P < .001). For posts containing warnings, a larger percentage of the warning label's pixel area was associated with fewer comments (aIRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = .003). Flavored posts with health warnings placed in the upper image portion received more likes than posts with warnings in the lower portion (mean [SD], 34.6 [35.2] vs 19.9 [19.2] likes; aIRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.07-2.06; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of synthetic nicotine brand Instagram accounts, 87% of sampled posts did not adhere to FDA health warning requirements in tobacco promotions. Enforcement of FDA compliant health warnings on social media may reduce youth engagement with tobacco marketing.",both,
39186542,"Classification of SARS-CoV-2 sequences as recombinants via a pre-trained CNN and identification of a mathematical signature relative to recombinant feature at Spike, via interpretability","The global impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the need for a deeper understanding of viral evolution to anticipate new viruses or variants. Genetic recombination is a fundamental mechanism in viral evolution, yet it remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive research on the genetic regions associated with genetic recombination features in SARS-CoV-2. With this aim, we implemented a two-phase transfer learning approach using genomic spectrograms of complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences. In the first phase, we utilized a pre-trained VGG-16 model with genomic spectrograms of HIV-1, and in the second phase, we applied HIV-1 VGG-16 model to SARS-CoV-2 spectrograms. The identification of key recombination hot zones was achieved using the Grad-CAM interpretability tool, and the results were analyzed by mathematical and image processing techniques. Our findings unequivocally identify the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S protein) as the pivotal region in the genetic recombination feature. For non-recombinant sequences, the relevant frequencies clustered around 1/6 and 1/12. In recombinant sequences, the sharp prominence of the main hot zone in the Spike protein prominently indicated a frequency of 1/6. These findings suggest that in the arithmetic series, every 6 nucleotides (two triplets) in S may encode crucial information, potentially concealing essential details about viral characteristics, in this case, recombinant feature of a SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. This insight further underscores the potential presence of multifaceted information within the genome, including mathematical signatures that define an organism's unique attributes.",computer_vision,"vgg-16, cnn, gan, vgg"
39182615,Artificial intelligence-driven automated lung sizing from chest radiographs,"Lung size measurements play an important role in transplantation, as optimal donor-recipient size matching is necessary to ensure the best possible outcome. Although several strategies for size matching are currently used, all have limitations, and none has proven superior. In this pilot study, we leveraged deep learning and computer vision to develop an automated system for generating standardized lung size measurements using portable chest radiographs to improve accuracy, reduce variability, and streamline donor/recipient matching. We developed a 2-step framework involving lung mask extraction from chest radiographs followed by feature point detection to generate 6 distinct lung height and width measurements, which we validated against measurements reported by 2 radiologists (M.K.I. and R.R.) for 50 lung transplant recipients. Our system demonstrated <2.5% error (<7.0 mm) with robust interrater and intrarater agreement compared with an expert radiologist review. This is especially promising given that the radiographs used in this study were purposely chosen to include images with technical challenges such as consolidations, effusions, and patient rotation. Although validation in a larger cohort is necessary, this study highlights artificial intelligence's potential to both provide reproducible lung size assessment in real patients and enable studies on the effect of lung size matching on transplant outcomes in large data sets.",computer_vision,"deep learning, artificial intelligence"
39181806,Cross-modal Transfer Learning Based on an Improved CycleGAN Model for Accurate Kidney Segmentation in Ultrasound Images,"OBJECTIVE: Deep-learning algorithms have been widely applied in the field of automatic kidney ultrasound (US) image segmentation. However, obtaining a large number of accurate kidney labels clinically is very difficult and time-consuming. To solve this problem, we have proposed an efficient cross-modal transfer learning method to improve the performance of the segmentation network on a limited labeled kidney US dataset.
METHODS: We aim to implement an improved image-to-image translation network called Seg-CycleGAN to generate accurate annotated kidney US data from labeled abdomen computed tomography images. The Seg-CycleGAN framework primarily consists of two structures: (i) a standard CycleGAN network to visually simulate kidney US from a publicly available labeled abdomen computed tomography dataset; (ii) and a segmentation network to ensure accurate kidney anatomical structures in US images. Based on the large number of simulated kidney US images and small number of real annotated kidney US images, we then aimed to employ a fine-tuning strategy to obtain better segmentation results.
RESULTS: To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we tested this method on both normal and abnormal kidney US images. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved a segmentation accuracy of 0.8548 in dice similarity coefficient on all testing datasets and 0.7622 on the abnormal testing dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with existing data augmentation and transfer learning methods, the proposed method improved the accuracy and generalization of the kidney US image segmentation network on a limited number of training datasets. It therefore has the potential to significantly reduce annotation costs in clinical settings.",computer_vision,"deep-learning, gan"
39155966,Examining the Role of Passive Design Indicators in Energy Burden Reduction: Insights from a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach,"Passive design characteristics (PDC) play a pivotal role in reducing the energy burden on households without imposing additional financial constraints on project stakeholders. However, the scarcity of PDC data has posed a challenge in previous studies when assessing their energy-saving impact. To tackle this issue, this research introduces an innovative approach that combines deep learning-powered computer vision with machine learning techniques to examine the relationship between PDC and energy burden in residential buildings. In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network computer vision model to identify and measure key indicators, including window-to-wall ratio (WWR), external shading, and operable window types, using Google Street View images within the Chicago metropolitan area as our case study. Subsequently, we utilize the derived passive design features in conjunction with demographic characteristics to train and compare various machine learning methods. These methods encompass Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression, culminating in the development of a comprehensive model for energy burden prediction. Our framework achieves a 74.2% accuracy in forecasting the average energy burden. These results yield invaluable insights for policymakers and urban planners, paving the way toward the realization of smart and sustainable cities.",computer_vision,"deep learning, convolutional neural network, neural network, machine learning"
39112796,A generalist vision-language foundation model for diverse biomedical tasks,"Traditional biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) models, designed for specific tasks or modalities, often exhibit limited flexibility in real-world deployment and struggle to utilize holistic information. Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners and patients. Here, we describe BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.",other,"biomedgpt, artificial intelligence, gpt, ai model"
39103610,Moving beyond processing- and analysis-related variation in resting-state functional brain imaging,"When fields lack consensus standard methods and accessible ground truths, reproducibility can be more of an ideal than a reality. Such has been the case for functional neuroimaging, where there exists a sprawling space of tools and processing pipelines. We provide a critical evaluation of the impact of differences across five independently developed minimal preprocessing pipelines for functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that, even when handling identical data, interpipeline agreement was only moderate, critically shedding light on a factor that limits cross-study reproducibility. We show that low interpipeline agreement can go unrecognized until the reliability of the underlying data is high, which is increasingly the case as the field progresses. Crucially we show that, when interpipeline agreement is compromised, so too is the consistency of insights from brain-wide association studies. We highlight the importance of comparing analytic configurations, because both widely discussed and commonly overlooked decisions can lead to marked variation.",computer_vision,
39098602,Validation of an automated segmentation method for body composition analysis in colorectal cancer patients using diagnostic abdominal computed tomography images,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several automated programs have been developed to facilitate body composition analysis of images from abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. External validation in patients with colorectal cancer is necessary for use in research and clinical practice. Our aim was to validate an automatic method (AutoMATiCA) of segmenting CT images at the third lumbar level (L3) from patients with colorectal cancer, by comparing with manual segmentation.
METHODS: Diagnostic abdominal CT scans of consecutive patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer were analysed to measure cross-sectional areas and tissue densities of skeletal muscle and intra-muscular, visceral, and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Trained analysts performed manual segmentation of L3 CT images using SliceOmatic. Automatic segmentation was performed using AutoMATiCA, an open-source software. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to assess segmentation accuracy. Agreement of automatic with manual segmentation was evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots with limits of agreement.
RESULTS: A total of 292 scans were included, of which 62% were from male patients. The agreement of AutoMATiCA with the manual segmentation was excellent, with median DSC values ranging from 0.900 to 0.991 and ICCs above 0.95 for all segmented areas. No systematic deviations were observed in Bland-Altman plots for all segmented areas, with overall narrow limits of agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: AutoMATiCA provides an accurate segmentation of abdominal CT images from patients with colorectal cancer. Our findings support its use as a highly efficient automated tool for body composition analysis in research and potentially also in clinical practice.",computer_vision,
